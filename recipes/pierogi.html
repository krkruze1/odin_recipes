        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Filling</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Parboil potatoes covered in cold water with 1 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>Bring to boil on high heat, then reduce heat to medium/low. Simmer until soft when testing with fork. Drain and let cool</li>
            <li>Saute butter and minced onions over medium low heat for 2 minutes</li>
            <li>Mash Potatoes and mix with farmers cheese and sauteed onions. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. During the holidays add <strong>extra</strong> black pepper to a small amount of filling for one pierog(Good luck to whoever gets it).</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Dough</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather ingredients</li>
            <li>Place 2 cups of flour on work surface and make a well in the center</li>
            <li>Break egg into the well and add 1 tbsp of salt, then slowly add 1 cup of lukewarm water</li>
            <li>Bring dough together, kneading well and adding more flour or water as required</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half and cover. Let it rest 20 minutes</li>
            <li>Roll out dough to roughly 1/8 inch thickness although some prefer thinner or thicker</li>
            <li>Using a glass cut out roughly 2 inch circles from the flattened dough</li>
            <li>Gather scraps and reroll to form as many  circles as possible</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Making Pierogi</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Spoon 1 1/2 tsp of filling onto each circle</li>
            <li>Fold dough in half into a semi circle and pinch edges together firmly.  Make sure the two sides join together otherwise the pierog might fall apart when boiling</li>
            <li>Boil water in low saucepan and drop an adequate number of pierogi in. Don't overcrowd or it will take longer to boil and pierogi might fal apart</li>
            <li>After pierogi are added bring water back up to boil then simmer for 5 minutes. When pierogi float to the top you're about halfway there.</li>
            <li>Remove boiled pierogi and put on plate. Grease with butter</li>
            <li>Repeat until all prepared pierogi are boiled</li>
            <li>Serve with caramelized onions or sour cream on the side</li>
            <li>Freeze or refrigerate leftovers. They can be reheated by boiling again (shorter time) or frying (preferred)</li>
        </ol>
